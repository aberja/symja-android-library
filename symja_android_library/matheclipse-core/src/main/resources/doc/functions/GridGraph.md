## GridGraph

```
GridGraph({v1,v2})
```

> returns the grid graph with `v1 x v2` vertices.

* [Wikipedia - Lattice graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph) 

### Examples

```
>> GridGraph({3,4}) // AdjacencyMatrix // MatrixForm
{{0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0},
 {0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0},
 {0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0}}
