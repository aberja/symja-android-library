## Depth

```
Depth(expr)
```

> gets the depth of `expr`.

```
Depth(expr, Heads->True)
```

> gets the depth of `expr` with head expressions included.

The depth of an expression is defined as one plus the maximum number of `Part` indices required to reach any part of `expr`, except for heads.

### Examples

```
>> Depth(x)
1
 
>> Depth(x + y)
2
 
>> Depth({{{{x}}}})
5
```

Complex numbers are atomic, and hence have depth 1:

```
>> Depth(1 + 2*I)
1
```
 
Generally `Depth` ignores heads.

```
>> Depth(f(a, b)[c])
2
```


But if you include the option `Heads->True`, the heads depth is included.

```
Depth(f(a, b)[c], Heads->True)
3
```
